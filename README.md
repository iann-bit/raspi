# raspi
Raspberry Pi Code
This was a school project that uses a Raspberry Pi computer and an add-on board called a SenseHAT, which has an 8x8 LED display and a few different motion sensors.
My goal was to create an animation on the LEDs that would display a cup full of water that appeared to be emptied as the SenseHAT was tilted to the left. 
I wrote the script in Python, and after completing the rudimentary code, I polished the animation of the cup filling up and then being poured. 
I had a lot of fun writing it, and learned a lot about Python in the process.
